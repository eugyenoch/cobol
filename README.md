# cobol
COmmon Business Oriented Language is a compiled computer programming language designed for business use. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. 
COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages.
